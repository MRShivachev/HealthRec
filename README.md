   - Comprehensive patient profiles
   - Medical history tracking
   - Medication management
   - Allergy and immunization records

2. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - Calendar interface for scheduling
   - Patient appointment reminders
   - Resource allocation optimization
   - Conflict detection and resolution

3. **Laboratory Integration**
   - Test order management
   - Results reporting and storage
   - Abnormal result flagging
   - Historical test comparison

4. **Health Data Analysis**
   - Decision tree algorithms for health data classification
   - Trend analysis for patient health metrics
   - Customizable reporting tools
   - Visualization of health patterns

5. **Additional Features**
   - Secure messaging between healthcare providers
   - Document management for medical reports
   - Audit trails for data access and modifications
   - Patient portal integration capabilities

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 7.0 SDK or later
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or compatible IDE

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/patient-healthcare-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd patient-healthcare-management
   ```

3. Restore dependencies:
   ```
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`

5. Apply migrations to create the database:
   ```
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```
